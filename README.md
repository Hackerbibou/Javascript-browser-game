<Cardi E>: card guessing
A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

I want to build a single player game, that make the user choose between 16 cards. 
When two identical cards are flipped, they stay at flip position (meaning you guessed one set)
else if the two card aren't identical, the cards return back to their flip position.
For each game, there should be a 2 set of 8 cards positioned at random and a set amount of time to finish the game.
Each cards will be chosen at random with math.random. Before adding a card at the position Math.random selected, we check if there was any cards present. When all cards are flipped before timer ends, You win, else, you lose
